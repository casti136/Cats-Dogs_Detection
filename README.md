# Cats-Dogs_Detection
Using Machine Learning algorithms with the help of Keras, Tensorflow, and several other libraries.

Data Set from "Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset"

Get_data_train.py  -  Convert Images to two Matrices that can be passed onto CNN (with Keras) and saves as csv files

DataY.csv, DataX.csv - DataY is the label data from Get_data_train.py and DataX.csv is image data from the same python file.(In the file, I used pickle, but could also use numpy to save)
